              There is a book I really like that says "Everything is mind, the universe is mental". I really like that sentence.
              I mean I´m aware that if I punch a wall my hand is gonna hurt, but if you think about it for a second, the wall I might punch is part
              of a building, let´s say a house. So in order for the house to exist, someone had to tought about it first about wanting to build it, then someone
              elses designed it and some other people built it. In conclussion, to be materialized in this 3d world someone had to think about this house first (you get the idea haha).
              So pretty much everything that we see in the world that was man made in the beggining was an idea, this is exactly what happened with Uros, and 
              how it was created.

              Sherpas allow other people from all over the world reach the peak of the highest mountain on planet earth.
              Any expedition requires their support even health assistance or rescues if needed. They count with the trainning and the skill
              to carry climbing equipment, oxygen tanks, aids kits and so on.
              Possibly their physiognomy its different to us, the people living closer or at the sea level. Over the course of the years, their bodies have adapted to very rough conditions (such a slippery surface and the lack of oxygen) that and you add up the fact that they
              alway have the will and strength to always move forward is what never stops surprising me. (Here´s a really cool documentary about the Sherpas)

              Diariamente no nos enfrentemos a escalar la montaña más alta del
              mundo, pero si hay una similitud entre escalar el Everest e ir al
              trabajo o universidad; siempre pueden presentarse condiciones
              adversas, grandes o pequeñas, que nos hagan abandonar nuestro camino
              hacia una nueva vista o perspectiva. En ellas es cuando creo que
              debemos recordar a los sherpas y pensar: ¿cómo afrontarían ellos este
              reto? Preguntémonos si hoy podemos poner en práctica lo que se conoce
              como mentalidad sherpa e ir, apoyándonos con otros, hacia la cima.

              We certainly dont try to climb the highest mountain in the world on a daily basis, but we do certainly 
              face a series of challenges through life. One will always face adverse situations day after day, sometimes big, sometimes small.
              If we can learn something from the Sherpa attitude towards the challenges and our own challenges and daily battles is that 
              one should always thrive and pursue the peak (the peak is a metaphor), but not only that but always help other people to reach the top of the mountain with you.
              Always push forward and grind, but helping your brothers and sisters, this is what I like to call "Sherpa mentality"
